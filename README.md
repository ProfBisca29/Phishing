This project is designed strictly for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes. Unauthorized phishing attempts are illegal and unethical. Ensure you have explicit permission to deploy this project in any environment outside of a controlled lab setup.

This project is a custom phishing simulation using a Snapchat login page replica, designed to demonstrate how phishing attacks are executed through fake login pages. It simulates a phishing attack where a user is tricked into entering their Snapchat credentials on a web page that appears identical to the real Snapchat login interface. The credentials entered by the user are captured by a custom PHP script and stored in a credentials.txt file on the server. The custom code behind this attack showcases how simple but effective social engineering techniques can be used to harvest sensitive information. This project is intended for educational purposes only, providing a hands-on demonstration of web application vulnerabilities, credential harvesting, and the use of custom web code to exploit these vulnerabilities. Please note that this project is strictly for ethical hacking and testing in controlled environments.
