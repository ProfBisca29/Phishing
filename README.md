This project is designed strictly for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes. Unauthorized phishing attempts are illegal and unethical. Ensure you have explicit permission to deploy this project in any environment outside of a controlled lab setup.

This project provides a sophisticated phishing simulation that demonstrates a fundamental understanding of web-based credential harvesting techniques. It involves the construction of a simulated Snapchat login interface, customized scripting using PHP, and secure handling of captured data within a local server environment. The project integrates HTML, PHP, and server configuration, providing a deeper understanding of both the creation and detection of phishing attacks, which is vital for cybersecurity training.
